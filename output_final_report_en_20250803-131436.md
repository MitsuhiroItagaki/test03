## 3. Liquid Clustering Recommendations

### High-Priority Tables

#### 1. store_sales (Highest Priority)
- **Table size**: 159.60GB
- **Current clustering key**: Not configured
- **Recommended clustering**: ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk
- **Filter rate**: 90.1% (read: 159.60GB, pruned: 143.64GB)

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.store_sales 
CLUSTER BY (ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk);
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.store_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale:**
- Large table size (159.60GB) makes clustering highly beneficial
- ss_sold_date_sk and ss_item_sk are used in JOIN conditions with IS NOT NULL filters
- Note: In Liquid Clustering, column order doesn't affect node-level data locality
- Expected benefit: Improved scan efficiency and file pruning

#### 2. catalog_sales (High Priority)
- **Table size**: 121.20GB
- **Current clustering key**: Not configured
- **Recommended clustering**: cs_sold_date_sk, cs_item_sk
- **Filter rate**: Not available (high filter rate expected)

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.catalog_sales 
CLUSTER BY (cs_sold_date_sk, cs_item_sk);
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.catalog_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale:**
- Large table size (121.20GB) makes clustering highly beneficial
- cs_sold_date_sk and cs_item_sk are likely used in JOIN conditions
- Expected benefit: Improved scan efficiency and file pruning

#### 3. web_sales (High Priority)
- **Table size**: 60.17GB
- **Current clustering key**: Not configured
- **Recommended clustering**: ws_sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk
- **Filter rate**: Not available (high filter rate expected)

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.web_sales 
CLUSTER BY (ws_sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk);
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.web_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale:**
- Substantial table size (60.17GB) makes clustering beneficial
- ws_sold_date_sk and ws_item_sk are likely used in JOIN conditions
- Expected benefit: Improved scan efficiency and file pruning

### Not Recommended for Clustering

#### 4. item
- **Table size**: 0.03GB
- **Current clustering key**: Not configured
- **Recommendation**: No clustering needed (table too small)

**Alternative approach:**
```sql
-- Liquid Clustering not recommended due to small table size
-- Alternative: CREATE INDEX ON tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.item (i_item_sk);
```

**Rationale:**
- Small table size (0.03GB) means it's likely cached in memory
- Clustering overhead would exceed benefits
- Consider indexing instead for small tables

#### 5. date_dim
- **Table size**: 0.00GB
- **Current clustering key**: Not configured
- **Recommendation**: No clustering needed (table too small)

**Alternative approach:**
```sql
-- Liquid Clustering not recommended due to tiny table size
-- Alternative: CREATE INDEX ON tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.date_dim (d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy);
```

**Rationale:**
- Extremely small table size means it's fully cached in memory
- Clustering would provide no benefit

## 4. Query Optimization Analysis

After multiple optimization attempts, no significant improvements were achieved over the original query.

**Optimization trials:**
- 3 attempts were executed
- No effective improvements were achieved
- Recommendation: Use the original query as-is

**Original query:**
```sql
USE CATALOG tpcds;
USE SCHEMA tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc;
with cross_items as (
select
i_item_sk ss_item_sk
from
item,
(
select
iss.i_brand_id brand_id,
iss.i_class_id class_id,
iss.i_category_id category_id
from
store_sales,
item iss,
date_dim d1
where
ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk
and ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
and d1.d_year between 1998
AND 1998 + 4
intersect
select
ics.i_brand_id,
ics.i_class_id,
ics.i_category_id
from
catalog_sales,
item ics,
date_dim d2
where
cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk
and cs_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
and d2.d_year between 1998
AND 1998 + 4
intersect
select
iws.i_brand_id,
iws.i_class_id,
iws.i_category_id
from
web_sales,
item iws,
date_dim d3
where
ws_item_sk = iws.i_item_sk
and ws_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
and d3.d_year between 1998
AND 1998 + 4
)
where
i_brand_id = brand_id
and i_class_id = class_id
and i_category_id = category_id
)
```

## 5. Key Recommendations

1. **Implement Liquid Clustering** for the three largest tables:
   - store_sales (159.60GB)
   - catalog_sales (121.20GB)
   - web_sales (60.17GB)

2. **Maintain current query structure** as optimization attempts did not yield improvements

3. **Consider indexing** for small tables (item, date_dim) instead of clustering

4. **Monitor cache efficiency** (currently at 15.4%) after implementing clustering to verify improvements

## 3. Liquid Clustering Optimization Recommendations

### High-Priority Tables

#### 1. store_sales Table (Highest Priority)
**Table Size**: 159.60GB  
**Current Clustering Key**: ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk  
**Recommended Clustering Columns**: ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk

```sql
-- Current clustering key is already optimal - no changes needed
-- Reference: Current clustering key = ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk
-- Run the following to optimize clustering if needed:
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.store_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale**:
- **Size Assessment**: 159.60GB - Large table, strongly recommended for clustering
- **Key Selection**: Current keys match query patterns (JOIN and filter conditions)
- **Expected Benefit**: Current configuration is optimal
- **Filter Rate**: 0.9010 (read: 15.96GB, pruned: 143.64GB)

#### 2. catalog_sales Table (High Priority)
**Table Size**: 121.20GB  
**Current Clustering Key**: cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk  
**Recommended Clustering Columns**: cs_sold_date_sk, cs_item_sk

```sql
-- Optimize clustering key order
ALTER TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.catalog_sales 
CLUSTER BY (cs_sold_date_sk, cs_item_sk);
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.catalog_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale**:
- **Size Assessment**: 121.20GB - Large table, strongly recommended for clustering
- **Key Selection**: Same columns but optimized order based on query patterns
- **Important Note**: In Liquid Clustering, key order doesn't affect node-level data locality
- **Expected Benefit**: Improved scan efficiency and file pruning
- **Filter Rate**: Estimated 0.85-0.90 (read: ~12-18GB, pruned: ~103-109GB)

#### 3. web_sales Table (High Priority)
**Table Size**: 60.17GB  
**Current Clustering Key**: ws_item_sk, ws_sold_date_sk  
**Recommended Clustering Columns**: ws_sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk

```sql
-- Optimize clustering key order
ALTER TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.web_sales 
CLUSTER BY (ws_sold_date_sk, ws_item_sk);
OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.web_sales FULL;
```

**Rationale**:
- **Size Assessment**: 60.17GB - Large table, strongly recommended for clustering
- **Key Selection**: Same columns but optimized order based on query patterns
- **Important Note**: In Liquid Clustering, key order doesn't affect node-level data locality
- **Expected Benefit**: Improved scan efficiency and file pruning
- **Filter Rate**: Estimated 0.85-0.90 (read: ~6-9GB, pruned: ~51-54GB)

### Low-Priority Tables

#### 4. item Table (Not Recommended)
**Table Size**: 0.03GB  
**Current Clustering Key**: i_item_sk  
**Recommendation**: No clustering needed due to small size

```sql
-- Liquid Clustering NOT recommended due to small table size
-- Alternative: CACHE TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.item; -- For faster memory access
-- Or: OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.item; -- To consolidate small files
```

**Rationale**:
- **Size Assessment**: 0.03GB - Very small table, clustering not recommended
- **Better Alternative**: Memory caching would be more efficient
- **Expected Benefit**: Limited benefit from clustering; overhead would exceed gains

#### 5. date_dim Table (Not Recommended)
**Table Size**: 0.00GB  
**Current Clustering Key**: d_date_sk, d_year  
**Recommendation**: No clustering needed due to tiny size

```sql
-- Liquid Clustering NOT recommended due to tiny table size
-- Alternative: CACHE TABLE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.date_dim; -- For faster memory access
-- Or: OPTIMIZE tpcds.tpcds_sf1000_delta_lc.date_dim; -- To consolidate small files
```

**Rationale**:
- **Size Assessment**: 0.00GB - Extremely small table, clustering not recommended
- **Better Alternative**: Memory caching would be more efficient
- **Expected Benefit**: No benefit from clustering; overhead would exceed gains
